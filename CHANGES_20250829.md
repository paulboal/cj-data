### 1 - Relabel Tile grid to start at ZZ and descend in letters

I did this by first refactoring all of our logic out into a separate plotter.py file and the Plotter class. This way, things like gid origin, label, and label direction can be configured from one run to the next.

Code has been tested using original Moab data set.
